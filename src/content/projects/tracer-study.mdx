**Tracer Study Polinema** is a website that trace alumni career paths by filling up survey, alumni employer can also evaluate alumni's performance by survey, so that Polinema (Politeknik Negeri Malang) can evaluate their curriculum or learning system and increasing them in order to produce high quality and competent student by industry standard. This project uses `Laravel` framework with `blade` template and `Mysql` database, and also integrate with `Docker sail`.

This is my final project assignment of 4th semester, working in group consist of 5 students including me, each has their own tasks, and me as project manager but also do the coding stuffs. Working with inexperience people who never do web programming is stressfull, especially if they dont want to cooperate, but fortunately my team mates were willignly to cooperate and listen to me as project manager. It teaches me a lot of non technical stuffs and how to manage people.
