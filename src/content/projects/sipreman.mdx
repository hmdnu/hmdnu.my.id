**Sipreman** is an acronym for Sistem Informasi Prestasi Mahasiswa Politeknik Negeri Malang, designed to be alternative of the current SKKM (Satuan Kredit Kegiatan Mahasiswa) digital platform which is not a very good web app. This designed with good UI/UX and auto convert student's achievments and organization activities to SKKM point credit. Built with native `PHP`, `Mysql` database, and `Tailwindcss`. Also following Laravel's framework design pattern, I was able to build simple migration and seeder feature, also implemented basic SQL Builder although its not perfect but it worked.

The web is not 100% done due to limited time and this was my first time writing native `PHP` fullstack web app. I was an idealist back then, i want my web to have fully implementation of Laravel's nice features, but this is also my first time writing `PHP` so i had a hard time figuring out how PHP works, it was fun though. This project was not build by solely myself this is a group project consist of 5 people including me, my team didnt have any experience of writing real coding project so they lacked skill, but they managed to finish their tasks with the help from LLMs and guides from me.
